      <h4>Activity Recognition</h4>
      <p>Activity Recognition is very important in everyday life. The task of video activity recognition has been getting a lot of attention in recent years. In this task we are given a set of videos of laboratory experiments and we need to detect what activities are being done by the person in the video. The task is very difficult especially when , (1) There is no limit on the number of labels (activities and objects) for a given frame, (2) There is a correlation between neighbouring frames (since there is a list of steps that the person needs to follow to complete a given task), (3) When there are different subjects doing the tasks in different videos, and (4) Different objects have similar appearances. 
We are trying to implement various Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) to improve the performance of methods. The inputs to these PGMs are vectors of features extracted from Convolutional Neural Network like SlowFast model and InceptionV3. 
Multiple PGMs were tried to improve the performance -</p>
