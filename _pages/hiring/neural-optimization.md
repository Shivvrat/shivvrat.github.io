## Neural Combinatorial and Constrained Optimization

### Project Overview

We invite motivated undergraduate, MS, and Ph.D. researchers to join a project on **Neural Combinatorial and Constrained Optimization**, focusing on learning-based approaches for discrete and NP-hard problems.

The project aims to build neural solvers that learn search strategies, constraint handling, and decision heuristics, complementing or surpassing classical optimization techniques in scalability and generalization.

---

### Research Focus Areas

**1. Neural Architectures for Structured Optimization**

- Developing scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms for combinatorial reasoning.
- Designing architectures that generalize to large-scale instances and varying graph topologies.
- Benchmarking neural solvers against classical heuristics on routing, scheduling, and coverage tasks.

**2. Constrained Learning & Hybrid Solvers**

- Integrating hard constraints via differentiable optimization layers and implicit differentiation.
- Creating hybrid algorithms that combine deep learning with classical methods (e.g., Branch-and-Bound).
- Learning to satisfy complex logic and discrete constraints while optimizing objectives.

---

### What You'll Work On

- Design neural architectures for optimization problems
- Develop training algorithms that respect problem constraints
- Benchmark against classical solvers and analyze trade-offs
- Apply methods to real-world optimization problems (scheduling, routing, planning)
- Build scalable implementations that handle large problem instances

---

### What We're Looking For

**Essential:**

- Strong background in algorithms and optimization
- Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Jax)
- Understanding of graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and complexity theory
- Experience with reproducible research practices
- Experience with classical optimization (integer programming, constraint programming)

**Nice-to-have:**

- Familiarity with graph neural networks or attention mechanisms
- Background in operations research or algorithmic game theory
- Publications in ML/AI or optimization venues

---

### What You'll Gain

- Deep expertise in neural optimization algorithms
- Experience with state-of-the-art deep learning and optimization techniques
- Understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization
- Opportunities to publish at top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, etc.)
