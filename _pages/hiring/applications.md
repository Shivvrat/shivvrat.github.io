## Applications of Neurosymbolic Methods

### Project Overview

This project explores how neurosymbolic methods, probabilistic inference, and learning-based optimization can be applied to real-world domains. Students will work on combining neural perception with symbolic structure, uncertainty modeling, and interpretable reasoning to address applied problems in vision, human-AI interaction, healthcare, energy systems, and multimodal understanding.
