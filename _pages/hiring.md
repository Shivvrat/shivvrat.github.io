### Position snapshot

- **University**: NJIT (R1), Newark, NJ
- **Start**: ASAP; Spring and Fall admission cycles

---

### What we work on (focus areas)

Neurosymbolic AI; combinatorial optimization; scalable training/inference; probabilistic modeling and inference; graphical models; explainable/interpretable AI; computer vision, video understanding, and language-grounded reasoning.

Examples include neuro-symbolic integration, optimization-for-ML, tractable inference schemes, interpretable modeling for structured systems, and temporal reasoning for vision.

**Representative directions:**

- Integrating formal world models with neural networks
- Efficient algorithms for NP-hard problems
- Interpretable models enabling polynomial-time reasoning

---

### What you’ll do

- Prototype novel algorithms and run ablations at scale
- Build reliable research code and reproducible pipelines
- Design and analyze experiments; interpret results and iterate
- Apply methods to vision/video and multimodal tasks

---

### What you bring

- Strong fundamentals in algorithms, probability, and ML/AI
- Proficiency in Python; experience with modern DL frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Jax)
- Familiarity with data structures, optimization, and graph-based models
- Sound engineering practices: Git, testing, reproducibility
- Plus (nice-to-have): graphical models, neuro-symbolic methods, combinatorial optimization, or computer vision

---

### Outcomes

Depth in probabilistic reasoning, deep learning, optimization, and interpretable modeling; experience with tractable inference and neuro-symbolic integration; and applications to video/activity understanding and language reasoning.

---

### Lab resources

- Fully funded Ph.D. positions (RA/TA support)
- Access to high-performance computing resources and GPU clusters
- Strong mentorship; opportunities for top-tier publications
- Industry collaborations and internships

---

### Why NJIT

- Ranked #72 in the U.S. for AI & Machine Learning (CSRankings)
