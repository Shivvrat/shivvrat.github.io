### Updated: September 15, 2023

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).

I have multiple fully funded Ph.D. positions in the areas of neurosymbolic AI, probabilistic modeling and inference, explainable AI, combinatorial optimization, and their applications to computer vision, video understanding, and language reasoning. Master's and undergraduate students and self-funded visiting students/scholars are also welcome to apply.

---

## Details

NJIT is a top-tier R1 research university located in the New York metropolitan area, approximately 7 miles from New York City, a hub for major technology and research companies. Qualified candidates may have opportunities for research internships and joint projects with leading industrial partners.

The lab focuses on developing algorithms and systems at the intersection of machine learning and reasoning, including tractable probabilistic modeling, neural methods for inference, neuro-symbolic integration, and explainable AI. We also build practical systems for video understanding, activity recognition, and multimodal reasoning.

### Example Research Topics

- Neural approximators for MAP/MPE inference in probabilistic graphical models
- Tractable probabilistic modeling and efficient inference schemes
- Neuro-symbolic learning: integrating structured reasoning with deep learning
- Explainable and interpretable AI for structured and hybrid models
- Neural solvers for large-scale combinatorial optimization
- Computer vision and video understanding with reasoning over temporal structure

### Outcome

Students will gain expertise in modern AI methods, including probabilistic reasoning, deep learning, interpretable modeling, and optimization; experience with scalable training/inference; and exposure to applied domains such as computer vision and multimodal understanding.

## Requirements

1. Strong background in algorithms, machine learning/AI, and probability
2. Proficiency in Python; experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch)
3. Familiarity with data structures, optimization, and graph-based models
4. Software engineering skills: version control (Git), testing, and reproducible workflows
5. A degree in Computer Science or a closely related field (Undergraduate/Master applicants encouraged as well)

If you have prior experience in any of the following, please highlight it: probabilistic graphical models, neurosymbolic AI, combinatorial optimization, computer vision, or large-scale training/inference.
