### Welcome!

I am Shivvrat Arya, a Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas. My research lies at the intersection of neurosymbolic AI, probabilistic reasoning, and computer vision. I collaborate with [Dr. Vibhav Gogate](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/) and [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/) on several DARPA-funded projects:

- **DARPA** Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
- **DARPA** Perceptually-Enabled Task Guidance (PTG)
- **DARPA** Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR)

### Research Focus 

Broadly speaking, my research interests primarily focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, with an emphasis on neuro-symbolic and graph-based methods. I aim to develop AI systems that combine interpretability with powerful reasoning capabilities. Key areas include:

- **Neurosymbolic AI**: Integrating formal world models with neural networks
- **Probabilistic Methods**: Novel inference approaches for graphical models
- **Explainable AI**: Interpretable models supporting polynomial-time reasoning
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for NP-hard problems
- **Computer Vision**: Advanced video understanding and activity recognition

### Highlights

- Published research recognized with best paper awards, spotlight, and oral presentations
- Developed novel neural network-based inference methods for probabilistic models
- Released NeuPI, a neural network-based inference engine for probabilistic models
- Built real-time AR guidance systems for complex physical tasks
- Created CaptainCook4D, an egocentric 4D dataset for procedural task understanding

### Education

- Ph.D., Computer Science â€“ The University of Texas at Dallas
- M.S., Computer Science â€“ The University of Texas at Dallas
- B.Tech., Computer Science and Engineering â€“ IIIT Vadodara



<!-- ### Future Research Directions ðŸš€

I aim to advance the field of AI through:
- Scaling neurosymbolic systems to real-world applications
- Developing more robust probabilistic inference methods
- Creating interpretable AI systems for safety-critical domains -->
