</div>

### Welcome!

I am Shivvrat Arya (Shiv), a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. My research lies at the intersection of neurosymbolic AI, probabilistic reasoning, and computer vision. I collaborate with [Dr. Vibhav Gogate](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/) and [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/) on several DARPA-funded projects:

- **DARPA** Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
- **DARPA** Perceptually-Enabled Task Guidance (PTG)
- **DARPA** Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR)

### Research Focus 

Broadly speaking, my research interests primarily focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, with an emphasis on neuro-symbolic and graph-based methods. I aim to develop AI systems that combine interpretability with powerful reasoning capabilities. Key areas include:

- **Neurosymbolic AI**: Integrating formal world models with neural networks
- **Probabilistic Methods**: Novel inference approaches for graphical models
- **Computer Vision**: Advanced video understanding and activity recognition
- **Explainable AI**: Interpretable models supporting polynomial-time reasoning

### Recent Contributions

- Published research recognized with best paper awards spotlight and oral presentations
- Developed novel neural network-based inference methods for probabilistic models
- Created CaptainCook4D, an egocentric 4D dataset for procedural task understanding
- Built real-time AR guidance systems for complex physical tasks

### Education

- Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas (expected graduation: May 2025)
- M.S. in Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas 
- B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara (2019)



<!-- ### Future Research Directions ðŸš€

I aim to advance the field of AI through:
- Scaling neurosymbolic systems to real-world applications
- Developing more robust probabilistic inference methods
- Creating interpretable AI systems for safety-critical domains -->
