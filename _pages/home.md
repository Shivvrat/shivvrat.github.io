## Biography  

Shivvrat Arya is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Ying Wu College of Computing, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), where he serves as the Director of the <a href="https://aria-research-lab.github.io/">ARIA Lab</a> and as a Core Faculty member of the <a href="https://research.njit.edu/ai/">Center for AI Research</a>. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas under the supervision of <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/">Vibhav Gogate</a> and <a href="https://yuxng.github.io/">Yu Xiang</a>.

His research advances interpretable and trustworthy AI through two complementary directions:

1. Probabilistic reasoning, neurosymbolic AI, and explainable AI, applied to real-world problems in computer vision and natural language processing, and
2. Combinatorial and constrained optimization, with an emphasis on learning-based and neural approaches.

Dr. Arya’s work develops AI systems that integrate structured domain knowledge with data-driven learning. His contributions span graph-based inference, symbolic reasoning, and neural solvers for optimization, with applications in video understanding, activity recognition, and multimodal reasoning.
