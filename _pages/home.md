### Welcome!

I am Shivvrat Arya (you can call me Shiv (pronounced as [ sh ih v ])). Currently I am working with  <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/" target="_blank">Dr. Vibhav Gogate </a> and  <a href="https://yuxng.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yu Xiang </a> on Perceptually-Enabled Task Guidance (PTG) grant in which we are trying to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that guides users in the
performance of a wide range of cognitively challenging physical tasks. PTG will leverage recent advances in machine perception,
automated reasoning, and augmented reality. We are mainly working on the task of activity recognition on Egocentric Datasets like Epic Kitchens and Multi Label Datasets like Charades, AVA, Tacos and Wetlab.  

My research at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI) was focused on the use of non-iterative and advanced neural network structures to solve the problem of multi-label classification. Two journal paper submissions and one conference acceptance have been completed for this project. We used 15 datasets for the evaluation, which include yeast, scene, BibTeX, emotions, Enron, medical, corel5k, bookmarks, delicious, mediamill and the rcv1v2 series. 
The evaluation metrics used for the comparison were Hamming Loss, Ranking loss, One error, Coverage, and Average precision. We compared the proposed algorithm with the following state-of-the-art algorithms, Rank â€“ SVM, ELMOnline, MLKN, BPMLL, and ELM.

### About me

I am pursuing my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I aspire to become a researcher who exercises the skills gained through academic research, to solve problems in the discipline of Computer Science leading to the development of cutting edge technologies. I am consistently looking for arduous opportunities that would help me to test my knowledge and learn a new set of skills.
I am pursuing a Ph.D. and a M.S. degree in <a href="https://cs.utdallas.edu/education/graduate/" target="_blank">Computer Science </a> from the The University of Texas at Dallas, where I am working with <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/" target="_blank">Dr. Vibhav Gogate </a> and  <a href="https://yuxng.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yu Xiang </a>.
I hold B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara
