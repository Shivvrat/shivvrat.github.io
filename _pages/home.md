### Welcome!

I am Shivvrat Arya, but feel free to call me Shiv (pronounced as [ sh ih v ]). I am currently engaged in a collaborative research projects under the guidance of [Dr. Vibhav Gogate](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/) and [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/), funded by the DARPA Perceptually-Enabled Task Guidance (PTG) and DARPA Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) grants. Our goal is to develop AI technology that guides users in the performance of cognitively challenging physical tasks, leveraging breakthroughs in machine perception, automated reasoning, and augmented reality. 

My research integrates probabilistic graphical models with deep learning for computer vision tasks, emphasizing tractable probabilistic modeling and neuro-symbolic AI. I've developed novel neural network-based inference methods for probabilistic graphical models and explored advanced inference schemes for multi-label classification. These works have been recognized with best paper awards and oral presentations.

In video understanding, I've contributed to the development of pipelines and datasets for egocentric procedural error recognition, developed explainable models for human activity recognition, and explored predictive task guidance in augmented reality. My earlier work introduced innovative approaches to multi-label classification problems.

This research builds upon my previous work at IIT Indore, where I focused on non-iterative neural network architectures for multi-label classification challenges across diverse datasets.

### About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I am honing my research skills to address complex problems in Computer Science and contribute to the advancement of innovative technologies. I am always on the lookout for challenging opportunities that push the boundaries of my knowledge and allow me to acquire new skills.

In addition to my Ph.D., I am also pursuing an M.S. degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/education/graduate/) at UT Dallas, working closely with [Dr. Vibhav Gogate](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/) and [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/). I hold a B.Tech. Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara.
