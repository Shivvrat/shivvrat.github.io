## **Current Research Focus**

Dr. Arya's current research focuses on developing neuro-symbolic models that integrate deep neural architectures with symbolic reasoning and probabilistic frameworks; advancing tractable probabilistic modeling to support efficient and scalable inference; creating neural network–based solvers for large-scale combinatorial optimization; and designing methods for explainable AI in structured and hybrid systems, with applications in computer vision, activity recognition, and multimodal learning.
