description: |
  This course introduces the theoretical and computational techniques that serve as a foundation for the study of artificial intelligence (AI). Students will learn fundamental concepts in AI including search algorithms, knowledge representation, reasoning systems, and game theory, while gaining practical experience through programming assignments and projects.

  ### Learning Outcomes
  Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
  1. Implement and analyze uninformed and heuristic search techniques
  2. Apply local search algorithms to optimization problems
  3. Solve constraint satisfaction problems using various techniques
  4. Perform logical inference using the resolution algorithm
  5. Implement probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks
  6. Develop game-playing agents using adversarial search
  7. Analyze zero-sum games with hidden information
  8. Design solutions for non-zero-sum games with hidden information
